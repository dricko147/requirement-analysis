<h1>“Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”</h1>
<p>The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.</p>

<h2>“What is Requirement Analysis?”</h2>
<p>In systems engineering and software engineering, requirements analysis focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions to meet the new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing software or system requirements.</p>


<br>
<p>The Requirement analysis phase of SDLC is important in the software development life cycle process, it is used to identify and define the software. Developers work with stakeholders to determine the requirements of the software. This creates software beneficial to users.</p>

<h2>“Why is Requirement Analysis Important?”</h2>
<p>Requirements analysis is critical to the success or failure of a systems or software project. The requirements should be documented, actionable, measurable, testable, traceable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design.</p>

<h3>Reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC.</h3>
<h4>Requirements analysis in software development life cycle does the following:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clarifies the required features and overall vision of a new product. </li>
<li>Clarifies stakeholder expectations for that product.</li>
<li>Prevents conflict and communication gaps during development and testing.</li></ol>
